# React 18 test app

## Getting Started

We are going to use NextJS for this React test app that we are going to call "myproject".

NodeJS version 21 was installed using nvm and the we ran the command `npx create-next-app <project-name>`.

After creting the project, we can start the server with the `npm run dev` command.

NextJS taked the component being exported by default inside the `index.js` file as the app's starting point0 so, we can remove the one created by the dcript and add our own with any name we want (e.g. Index).
