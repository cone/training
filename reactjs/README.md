# React JS training

## What is React JS?
1. It's a library, not a famework (frameworks are often not flexible and large. We need to do things a certain way which can be a downside)
1. It's for building user interfaces, and only for that (we need other libraries for a complete solution)
1. It's declarative: we describe user interfaces and react builds them for us

## Why React JS
1. The virtual browser is friendlier than the real browser (DOM API)
1. There's a small API to learn and the rest it's "just javascript"
1. We can use our React skills to develop IOS and Android apps with React Native
1. The React team at facebook tests all new features added to react in the facebook site, so it's "Battle tested"
1. It's a declarative language
